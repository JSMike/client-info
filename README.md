Browser
=======

Check browser version

This is intended to check for the most popular browsers and thier features. This isnt the end all be all solution that https://github.com/NielsLeenheer/WhichBrowser provides


This plugin is taken from  http://stackoverflow.com/a/21342122 which itself was taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/18706818.

I've also ripped out the cookie check and instead used modernizers https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr

The main use for me is that we support certain browsers (the main ones) and would like to inform users gently that they arent supported and things may not work
